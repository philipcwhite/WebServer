# WebServer

## About
This is a simple webserver that I am writing using asyncio.  It is very early in development.  

## Updates
11/30/2018 - Updated the server to use a persistant cookie for session.  I will probably make the cookie setting optional so it can be better used for authentication with expiration.  Also cleaned up some code sections.  The App will be quite ugly for awhile.
